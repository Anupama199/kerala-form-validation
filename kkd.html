    <H4>Kallai</H4><br><br>
    <img src="kkd images/kallai.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The village of Kallayi, about six kms from Kozhikode city, has an archaic charm that attracts many. Its location on the banks of River Kallayi (that is linked to the Chaliyar river through a man-made canal) helped the village grow and prosper as a bustling timber trade centre during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 

        During that period, it became the largest timber trading centre in Asia. Timber was sent floating down from the forests of Nilambur to the various mills of Kallayi through Chaliyar and Kallayi rivers. Teak and rosewood, known for their strength and durability, were sawn to size in the timber mills here, before being transported for trade. 
        
        During the 20th century, there was a steep decline in trading activity. Today, only a few timber mills exist in the area, and one can spot a few logs from these timber yards floating on the Kallayi River. </p></p>
